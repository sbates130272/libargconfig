libargconfig is an old high level argument parsing code that is common
to much of the code in this repository. It uses getopt internally but
also automatically parses various types of arguments and generates the
help texts. Code that uses it is much easier to maintain.

This is a static library so it's only a build dependancy not a runtime
dependancy. Use "./waf install" to install it into the system so other
packages can find it.


To build, run:

  ./waf

To install, run:

  ./waf install
