libargconfig is an old high level argument parsing code that is common
to much of the code in this repository. It uses getopt internally but
also automatically parses various types of arguments and generates the
help texts. Code that uses it is much easier to maintain.

This is a static library so it's only a build dependancy not a runtime
dependancy. Use "./waf install" to install it into the system so other
packages can find it.


To build, run:

  ./waf

To install, run:

  ./waf install

Alternatively if you are using this as a submodule in a larger project
just use the Makefile to build the static library and link that into
your code at build time.

An example of how you might link libargconfig into another program's
Makefile is to carry out the following. Create libargconfig as a
submodule in that program. Add something like the following to the
Makefile for the master repo:

LIBARGCONFIGDIR=libargconfig

CFLAGS += -I$(LIBARGCONFIGDIR)/inc

$(LIBARGCONFIGDIR)/libargconfig.a:
	@$(NQ) echo "  MAKE   $@"
	$(Q)$(MAKE) -C $(LIBARGCONFIGDIR)

and to than add $(LIBARGCONFIGDIR)/libargconfig.a as a dependency for
the executable in the master program.
